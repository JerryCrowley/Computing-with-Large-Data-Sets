#Computing with Large Data Sets 
### Final Project

For out final project, my group decided to run a sentimental anaylsis on NFL games. 
Taking one particular game (Green Bay vs. New England), we ran python scrappers to scrape twitter tweets from 15min before the game to 15min after the game. 
We compiled our python scrapper results into R, where we ran sentimental anaylsises on them, creating graphics to showcase our results.
